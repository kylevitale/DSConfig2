# DSConfig2
A simple script to configure Directory Services for AD on OS X. 

Change all three computer names, bind and un-bind, and set AD config options without all that typing. Ugh.

# Usage

E.g. Change computer names, unbind, bind, and enable mobile accounts.

dsconfig2.py -n "MyNewComputerName" -p "MyBindingPassword" -cbm
