# DSConfig2
A simple script to more easily configure AD Directory Services on OS X.

Change all three computer names, bind and un-bind, and set AD config options without all that typing. Ugh.

# Usage

E.g. Change computer names, unbind, bind, and enable mobile accounts.

dsconfig2.py -n "MyNewComputerName" -p "MyBindingPassword" -cbm
